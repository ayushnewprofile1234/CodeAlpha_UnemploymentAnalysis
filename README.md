# CodeAlpha_UnemploymentAnalysis
Data visualization and analysis of India's unemployment trends using Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib). Includes COVID-19 impact and state-wise breakdown.
# 📊 Unemployment Analysis — CodeAlpha Data Science Internship (Task 2)

This project was completed as part of the **CodeAlpha Data Science Internship**.  
We analyze India's unemployment trends using publicly available data, focusing on the impact of **COVID-19**, and comparing **state-wise unemployment rates** over time.

## 🔍 Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed unwanted spaces and renamed columns for clarity.
   - Converted `Date` column into datetime format.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - 📊 **Bar chart** for average unemployment by state
   - 📈 **Lineplot** showing unemployment trend during COVID (2020)
   - 🔥 **Heatmap** to observe unemployment changes over time and states

3. **Insights & Interpretation**:
   - COVID-19 led to a massive spike in April–May 2020.
   - Haryana & Jharkhand had highest average unemployment.
   - Chhattisgarh & Meghalaya remained relatively stable.

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- April–May 2020 saw the **sharpest unemployment spikes** nationwide.
- **Urban states** like Delhi & Maharashtra were heavily impacted.
- **Regional differences** are clearly visible — some states recovered faster.
- These patterns can inform future **economic and policy planning**.
